Object of the project: 
By providing the reliable reviews of restaurants to clients, they will find famous restaurants easily

Summary of the service: 
We offer the reviews of restaurants with votes of users. So that way, Users of our service can select realiable reviews by themselves.
Users will make the reliable review system with their own communication using blockchain tech.
Also, we can verify which the users who write review of a restaurant really use the store by using smart contracts.
